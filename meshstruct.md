#### About:
In this project we want to create a 3D model of a rocky outcrop of the Corumbataí Formation (Permian, Paraná Basin, Brazil), where pelitic layers (claystones and siltstones) are cut by a swarm of [clastic dikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clastic_dike), and compare the structural information (geological attitude, thickness) from the 3D models with data collected in the field using traditional tools (geological compass, measuring tape). So far we managed to create the model with [Structure-from-Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion)--Multi-View Stereo (SfM-MVS), but we still want to do another one using [Terrestrial Laser Scanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_scanning) (TLS).

You can see the location of the outcrop in Google Maps [here](https://goo.gl/maps/UdkNeZfSbvQ2)

#### Students:  
**Mariana dos Santos Toledo Busarello (undergrad 2017)**  
For her monograph, Mariana worked with the 3D reconstruction of the outcrop with SfM-MVS, acquiring structural data from the clastic dikes with ply2atti and compared the data from the 3D model with data collected in the field.

**Camila Duelis Viana (PhD)** 
Camila acted as co-supervisor of Mariana's Bachelor degree final paper. Her experience with structural analysis from 3D models was essential for the successful development of the project. 

**Guilherme P. Bento Garcia (PhD)**  
Even though this project is not directly related to his PhD, Guilherme helped us in all field campaigns and in the discussions of the results.
