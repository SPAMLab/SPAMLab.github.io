### What?

This is the SPAMLab's website. Here we do all kinds of Spatial Analysis, including basic GIS stuff, Remote Sensing and Digital Terrain Analysis.

Our current projects include: applications of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or _drones_) and Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS, LiDAR) in characterizing features of geological or geomorphological interest, such as landslides, dune fields or geological structures in outcrops (dikes, fractures, faults etc); characterization of mineralizations based on spectrometry; restoration of deforested areas and 3D modelling of caves.

See our project pages and blog posts for more details on each activity.

The Lab hosted at the [Institute of Energy and Environment](http://www.iee.usp.br) of the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](http://www.usp.br) (Brazil), and is coordinated by [Prof. Carlos H. Grohmann](http://carlosgrohmann.com).
