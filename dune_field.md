title: Dune Field 3D
subtitle: TLS and SfM in the sand
---

Back in 2010 we acquired an airborne LiDAR survey of the Garopaba Dune Field, located in southern Brazil about 45km south of Florian√≥polis ([see it in Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@-28.0012704,-48.6400957,3466m/data=!3m1!1e3)), as part of the research grant [FAPESP #2009/17675-5](/grants#fapesp_lidar). We created some nice DTMs and evaluated how the calculated volume of sand would change with different spatial resolutions of the DTM ([Grohmann & Sawakuchi 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2012.09.012)).

Now we want to go back and create new DTM, this time using [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_scanning) and [SfM-MVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion). With the new models, we will be able to see if there was any change in sand volume and determine the migration rate of this dune field.   

<!-- The challenge here is the SfM-MVS part. The dunes are very homogeneous, both in terms of texture and of spectral response. We will try to use images acquired at different times of the day to see if the changes in illumination will provide enough features  -->
