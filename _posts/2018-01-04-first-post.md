Thanks to [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com), SPALab now has a website. This is still an early draft, and more sections and material will be added over the weeks to come. Thanks are extended to RECON ([The R Epidemics Consortium](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/)), since their site was used as an example to set up this one.
