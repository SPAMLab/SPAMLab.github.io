Today Mariana presented her Bachelor degree final paper! 

After a year of hard work both in the field and in the office, she made an excellent presentation of her work and the evaluation committee was very happy with the results, giving her the second highest grade of the class (9.7 out of 10.0)!. 

Congratulations to Mariana, our newest Geologist!
