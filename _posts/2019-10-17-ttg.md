The other day (October 16/2019) we had a nice field trip to the northern coast of São Paulo State. We wanted to check a landslide spotted on GoogleEarth, see if there was access to it, if it was a good place for a drone survey, etc.

The landslide is located in the southern portion of the São Sebastião City, close to the Toque-Toque Grande Beach. We asked permission to the land owners and accessed the landslide by a trail that goes trhough a nice open 'forest' of mango trees and then on open field. The view of the coast are awesome!

The landslide is about 300x100 meters and from the historical images of GoogleEarth we can see that it was just a linear erosion back in 2002, with constant changes until today. It will make a great subject for a future study (anyone looking for a Master's Thesis project?). 

We only had time for a quick survey with the drone, but hope to go back soon for a longer stay.
