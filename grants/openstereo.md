OpenStereo is an open source, cross-platform software for structural geology analysis.

After an initial release back in 2010, the software has been completely re-written by our alumni [Arthur Endlein](https://github.com/endarthur) and now it lives in [GitHub](https://github.com/spamlab-iee/os). 

If you're looking for the latest releases, [they are here.](https://github.com/spamlab-iee/os/releases/latest)

There's a short tutorial [here.](https://openstereo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)

If you're interested in the documentation (install notes, etc) [follow this link.](https://openstereo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

And if you're looking for the very old but still usable version there's a binary version for Windows [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pub/os/openstereo_0.1.2f_win32.zip) (no installation required, just unzip and run *OpenStereo.exe*), and the source code is [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pub/os/openstereo_0.1.2f_src.zip).
