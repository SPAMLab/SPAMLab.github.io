#### About:
Landslides are common geological phenomena in high-relief areas, occurring across a range of spatial and temporal scales, and are considered the main erosive process in the geomorphological evolution of such areas.  

When occurring close to inhabited zones their destructive effects cannot be underestimated, as well as their capacity to modify the landscape and the huge amount of debris carried to streams and rivers, which may impact water distribution and the environment.  

We have a continuous interest in landslides, with students working on their characterization from a morphological point of view with high-resolution DTMs, recognition and mapping with orbital mutispectral imagery, and evaluating the risk imposed by such events to urban settlements.
