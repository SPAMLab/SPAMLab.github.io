### Prof. Carlos Henrique Grohmann
I'm an Associate Professor (Geotechnologies) at the Institute of Energy and Environment, University of São Paulo, Brazil. My work is focused in Digital Terrain Analysis (Geomorphometry), free software (FOSS) and Remote Sensing.

My ORCiD is [0000-0001-5073-5572](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5073-5572). My Lattes CV is available in [Portuguese](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5846052449613692) or in [English](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?metodo=apresentar&id=K4769337Z5&idiomaExibicao=2). The Lattes Database is a Curriculum and institutions database of Science and Technology areas in Brazil.
