In this project we use digital photogrammetry (SfM) with multiscale terrestrial and UAV images in various geological environments in order to extract brittle structures parameters (fractures and faults) of rock massifs, comparing with classic data sampling (scanlines, area sampling, circular window) assessing the limitations that may exist and proposing solutions. 

### Students:
#### Camila Duelis Viana (PhD)  
Camila is leading the project. She is responsible for generating the 3D models and developing the code for automatic detection of faults and fractures. As part of her PhD duties, she is also involved with supervision of undergrad students.

#### Fernanda A. Ferretti (undergrad)  
For her monograph, Fernanda is working with an abandoned basalt quarry (now a city park). She will compare structural data obtained from the 3D models with those coleected in the field.
