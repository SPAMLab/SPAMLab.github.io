[[blog post]({{site.url}}/2018-07-10-devils_cave)]: TLS mapping of Devil's Cave  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### About:
In this project, we are mapping the touristic sector of the "Devil's Cave" with [Terrestrial Laser Scanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_scanning){:target="_blank"}.

The Devil's Cave, whose official name is "Tapagem Cave", was the first Brazilian cave to be fitted with artificial illumination and concrete pathways and stairs. This kind of infrastructure for tourism, along with a nice reception center and restaurant, attracts thousands of visitors every month.

Although the entire cave is over 7km long, only the first 600m are accessible by the pathways (this is what we call the 'touristic sector'). Recent policies implemented by the Park administration opened new 'adventure circuits' for tourism, stranding away from the concrete pathways and venturing into the 'river sector' or the 'Erectus Hall'.

#### Students:
**Gabriel Z. Sugiura (undergrad)**  
For his monograph, Gabriel is working with TLS data to produce a 3D model of the cave. With this model, we want to calculate the volume of the halls as well as the size and weight of some very large speleothems. The final point cloud will provide an interesting comparison with the existing maps of the cave.  

**Guilherme P. Bento Garcia (PhD)**  
Guilherme is acting as co-advisor to Gabriel and is working closely with him to learn how to process the TLS data and extract all the information we want.
